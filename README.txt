#Jeopardy
This project is a copy of the TV show game Jeopardy. At first code was developed by my partner Ernesto as a game for a contest that our Rotaract group made, Rotaract Tec de Monterrey. I took his code and I made several modifications to adapt it for a Game Jam to entertain the contestants.
If you want to know the work of Ernesto, you can visit his github at github.com/NetoDios.
